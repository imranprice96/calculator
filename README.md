# Calculator
Calulator created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

# Features
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Clear screen and backscpace buttons

# Limitations
The calculator functions correctly with a single calculation at a time.
This limits it functionality but removes the need to use order of operations 
which would be another challenge.

The result panel is a set size.
Currently when a number is too large, the div or text does not change when the
output is too large for the container.
